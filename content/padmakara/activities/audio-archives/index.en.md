##  The audio library: preservation of a unique audio heritage 

Since the Centre d’Etudes de Chanteloube was founded over thirty years ago, the teachings given there by all the great teachers have been recorded. Each of them is a priceless treasure. 

In several cases these audio recordings of teachings and commentaries by venerated lamas have been the starting point for translated versions published as books, allowing them to be distributed and read throughout the world instead of remaining inaccessible. For example, one of the last teachings given in the west by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche was transcribed, translated, and published as the book Enlightened Courage (French: Audace et compassion). A number of future book projects will be developed from this precious resource. 

In this age of multimedia, however, it is not only as printed books that these archives can be accessed. The numerous teachings that have been recorded over the years now constitute an irreplaceable living transmission of the Buddhadharma. Preserving, archiving and making available these audio recordings is now one of Padmakara’s designated roles. Today, the Association houses more than 3,000 recordings on audio cassettes and MDs (Compact Mini-discs), and many hundreds of hours of digital MP3 files. The collection is stored and catalogued for the use of teachers, scholars, and practitioners. 

##  Distribution on audio media 

![img_audio_graphic_100](/images/img_audio_graphic_100.jpg) Many of Chanteloube’s seminars are available to the public in MP3 format on CDs. In certain cases, respecting the Buddhist tradition, some recordings may be restricted and available only to students who have participated in the particular seminar, who have received the prerequisite transmissions, or who have been given permission by a lama. 

Our catalogue of available teachings should be on line soon. To order CDs of a particular talk organized by Chanteloube, please contact us by email. 

Please note that although ideally these teachings would be available free, a minimal charge is necessary to cover the basic production and distribution costs. 

##  Audio archives project: preservation & digital conversion 

Many of the older recordings in Padmakara’s unique Audio Library are analogue recordings on deteriorating magnetic media. It has now become extremely urgent to convert them to digital form before they disappear without trace. This major task is now under way, thanks to the efforts of an expert volunteer. To read more, please see the audio archives project.
