#  Publishing & distribution 

##  Padmakara Publishing 

Padmakara publishes its own books in French, in order to retain maximum control over quality and appearance, and to make sure that the translated texts remain available despite their specialised nature. The design and illustrations, electronic typesetting and layout of the books are supervised by Padmakara’s staff, who then follow production with the printers and binders.Distribution by online / mail order to individual customers and Buddhist centres is carried out by Padmakara’s own staff, while wholesale distribution to general and specialized retail bookshops is handled by a national distributor. Apart from one or two titles that have been published by major publishers, Éditions Padmakara thus publishes the majority of Padmakara’s French translations in book form. It also publishes practice texts in French, English and other languages in the form of booklets.

##  Padmakara’s goals and ethics as a publisher

Book published by Padmakara 

Padmakara’s sole aim is to preserve and spread the Buddha’s teachings to a world audience. To publish and distribute books effectively, Padmakara is obliged to operate in the commercial world of publishing, but is nevertheless committed to remaining a strictly non-profit organization. 

Moreover, Songtsen’s directors insist on maintaining as far as possible the Buddhist tradition by which it is considered ethically preferable for people not to live on income arising from the sale of sacred Dharma books. All revenue from book sales is therefore used solely to publish more books and texts. The translators’ work is funded by third-party sponsorships ensuring basic financial support, or in some cases volunteered. Sponsorships also cover a substantial proportion of the salaries of Padmakara’s administrative staff. 

Ideally, Padmakara would like one day to provide all its texts free of charge to all. This has been possible to a large extent in the East. However, printing costs in the West are significantly more expensive; distribution networks for free books do not exist; and the western public tends to view publications that are given away as either publicity or propaganda. Nevertheless, Padmakara has the long-term aspiration, if these problems can be solved, to make its publications free. In the meantime, the prices of its books reflect production and printing costs, but not the work of translating, researching and editing the texts.
