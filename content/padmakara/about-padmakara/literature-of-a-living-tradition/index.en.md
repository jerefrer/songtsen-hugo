Padmasambhava 

Padmasambhava and Shantarakshita, with Vimalamitra and over a hundred specially invited Indian scholars, trained Tibetan translators such as Vairotsana, Kawa Peltsek, Namkhai Nyingpo, Langdro Könchok Jungne, Kyeuchung Lotsa and others, and systematically set about the immense task of translating most of the texts of what now comprise the Kangyur and Tengyur, containing respectively the Buddha’s own words (in some 100 volumes), and the commentaries of the subsequent great Buddhist philosophers and masters of India (in some 225 volumes). 

A huge number of these texts were translated by this first generation of Tibetan translators over a relatively short time, although new translations continued to be added to these great collections, until the fourteenth century in the case of the Kangyur (when its content list was finally laid down by Butön) and until the seventeenth century in the case of the Tengyur (which was settled in its present form during the reign of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama). Other translated texts from India were gathered together in different collections. 

###  Disappearance of the source

Ancient Tibetan text cover 

Meanwhile, outside Tibet, and notably in India as it underwent successive waves of invasion and social change, much of the original literature had long been irretrievably lost, and the living traditions interrupted. By the early thirteenth century, the great Buddhist monastic university of Nalanda (which had been a flourishing centre of learning for eleven centuries) and the newer universities of Vikramashila and Odantapuri had all been destroyed as the Mughal invaders swept through India. The arrival of Islam and political changes in Indian society had driven the Buddhadharma from its land of origin, and it was in other countries that the teachings were preserved—the Theravada in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand and Cambodia, the Mahayana in China, Japan, Korea and Indochina, and the Vajrayana mainly in Tibet (although some Vajrayana traditions survived in Nepal and a limited Vajrayana tradition reached Japan). Tibet was doubly fortunate. Not only was it one of the few countries in which the Vajrayana continued to be practised, it was also the only one in which the full range of teachings, from all three traditions, was transmitted and preserved. 

###  The flourishing of indigenous literature

As great masters studied, practised and accomplished the Buddhist teachings in all their myriad methods and approaches, they recorded their insights and discoveries in commentaries to the scriptures, in liturgies, in poems and songs of realization, in systematic surveys of the path, and in profound pith-instructions. Debates between masters and traditions on the finer points of meaning led to texts of extraordinary depth and scope on a huge range of philosophical and contemplative points. While a large majority of writings concentrated on Buddhist philosophy and practice, traditionally classified as ‘inner science’ or metaphysics, the scope of both translated and indigenous Tibetan literature is vast, covering a wide range of subjects, classified into the other four major sciences (medicine, technology and the arts, grammar, and logic) and the five minor sciences (astrology, poetics, prosody, and drama).

Milarepa 

One might imagine that Tibet’s greatest glories belong to the remote past, and that recent centuries represent a period of decline, but this is by no means the case. In fact each century (including the twentieth) and each generation has produced its share of spiritual giants. To name but a few: Atisha, Rongzom, Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa and Padampa Sangye in the eleventh and twelfth; Sakya Pandita in the thirteenth; Butön, Thangthong Gyalpo, Longchenpa and Tsongkhapa in the fourteenth and fifteenth; Ngari Panchen, Taranatha, the Fifth Dalai Lama and Terdak Lingpa in the sixteenth and seventeenth; Shabkar, and Jigme Lingpa and his disciples in the eighteenth. The nineteenth century saw a particular kind of renaissance in the ri-med or non-sectarian movement, inaugurated by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Jamgön Kongtrul and others, which sought to break down the barriers that had crystallized between the different Buddhist schools by studying and teaching them all impartially, and writings by the profusion of great masters who followed such as Patrul, Mipham, Jigme Tenpai Nyima, the third Shechen Gyaltsab, and many others, as well as those of inspired tertöns like Chokyur Lingpa and Dudjom Lingpa, constitute an extraordinary flowering of Tibetan Buddhist thought which continued unabated through the first half of the twentieth century. Indeed, despite the unimaginable upheaval caused by the invasion of Tibet, many accomplished scholars, including Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and Dudjom Rinpoche, continued to contribute to Tibetan literature in exile. 

Finally, a survey of Tibetan literature would be incomplete without mention of the ever-increasing body of secular writing—novels, drama, history, political and social commentary, journalism—both from the diaspora and from within Tibet, that bears witness to Tibetan culture’s encounter with the modern world and the continuing strength of a deeply rooted tradition. 

Tibet’s own history was not exempt from upheavals and political changes, but a combination of its geographical isolation, and the profound respect felt over the centuries by its inhabitants for the sacred texts, ensured the survival and evolution of this uniquely rich body of culture, knowledge and wisdom, combining the intact legacy of Indian Buddhist thought with the deep insights and experience built up by so many generations of Tibetans dedicating themselves entirely to Buddhist study and practice, over almost thirteen centuries. 

###  The disaster begins 

Extraordinarily long though it was, this cultural continuity was to be tragically and brutally interrupted. Starting in 1949, and completed ten years later, the Communist invasion and occupation of Tibet led to the death of over 1 million Tibetans. Among them, and particularly targeted, were thousands of the most learned scholars and accomplished masters, who were imprisoned, tortured and killed. Most of the major libraries and monasteries were totally destroyed. Many of these libraries contained the last remaining texts of their kind in the world, their Sanskrit originals having been lost or destroyed. In all, a devastating number of Tibetan texts was destroyed. Some are now completely lost. 

Just one example is the library of Riwoche monastery, among whose treasures were the rarest ancient Indian manuscripts, rescued in the thirteenth century by Sönam Pal from the universities of both Nalanda and Vikramashila during their destruction by the Mughal invaders. The library also housed a vast collection of unique translations of Buddhist teachings and the writings of great Tibetan scholars and masters. Indeed, the collection was so vast that only by the most arduous efforts could the Communist troops destroy it all. The fires were kept ablaze for months on end, until finally the very last of the books was annihilated. 

###  Carried to a precarious safety 

[ ![Rescuing and preserving texts](/images/img_conservation_texte-150x150.jpg) ](/images/img_conservation_texte.jpg)

Rescuing and preserving texts 

Despite the massive destruction of large libraries, not everything of Tibetan literature was lost. As the invasion began and it soon became obvious that Tibetan Buddhist culture was not going to survive in Tibet, among the hundreds of thousands of Tibetans who risked their lives to escape into the neighbouring countries of Nepal, India and Bhutan, were numerous Tibetan scholars and masters carrying their precious texts. Many of them left behind all their valuable ornaments and possessions, choosing instead to bring as many books as could be carried on the rigorous and perilous journey across the Himalayas. It is thanks to their tremendous efforts that many precious texts survived destruction. 

But even then their books were not in security, for another difficult period awaited them, in the precarious conditions of the early makeshift refugee camps. Gradually, the exiled lamas began to construct new settlements, monasteries and libraries. Thanks largely to the hard work of the U.S. Library of Congress’ representative in Delhi, Mr Gene Smith, the nineteen-seventies saw a wave of copying, reprinting and publishing of all the books that had been carried out of Tibet in the preceding decades. Catalogues began to be compiled, and it was possible to see more clearly what had survived and what was still missing. Later, starting in the nineteen-nineties and continuing still, computer input of many of the great collections of texts could be undertaken, further safeguarding them and rendering them more accessible. More recently still, it became clear that not only rare and precious manuscripts, but even texts reprinted in the seventies, were still being lost or were decaying in the damp conditions of some of the monasteries, and a new programme to safeguard them more rapidly by computerized scanning and archiving was set up by the [ Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center ](http://www.tbrc.org) , again thanks to the foresight and encyclopaedic knowledge of Gene Smith. 

In Tibet, the occupation continued, and even now Tibetans are far from free to adhere to their traditional culture. But as the fiercely destructive frenzy of the cultural revolution gradually abated, a few rare texts that had been hidden for decades to protect them from harm began, little by little, to reappear. Copies were brought out to India and Nepal, or in some cases re-published in Tibet itself or China. Scholars and researchers are still discovering, identifying and restoring works that everyone thought had been lost entirely. 

The full wealth of Tibet’s literature will probably never be completely restored, but thanks to the extraordinary importance that Tibet’s scholars and lamas accorded their precious texts, a miraculous number of them have been preserved despite the catastrophe. Strenuous efforts must still be made to ensure their continuing survival—and to make them available to a world in sore need of the knowledge and wisdom they contain. 

###  Making this world heritage accessible in translation 

[ ![Wheel of existences](/images/img_roue-150x150.jpg) ](/images/img_roue.jpg)

Wheel of existences 

To preserve disappearing or threatened cultures and their literature is always of great importance. Tibetan literature, however, is not simply the recorded poetry, mythology and folk lore of a distant, minority ethnic group. It contains a huge depth and range of both major and lesser-known texts of a major world religion and classical philosophical tradition, together with a vast body of writings by Tibetan scholars and practitioners recording the accumulated knowledge, experience and research of more than a millennium. Far more of the scriptures and major works of Buddhist scholarship are available in Tibetan than in the original Sanskrit and Pali. Even in Chinese-speaking countries, where quite a number of translations of Buddhist texts still exist (though far less numerous than those to be found in Tibetan), they are written in an ancient language seldom understood nowadays by modern readers. 

Not only is this great treasury of writing invaluable in its own right as part of human history and culture, it is also of the utmost interest and relevance in today’s world. As the limits and dangers of technological and material development become clearer, the importance of a spiritual path that can instil more profound and fundamental values becomes more and more obvious. The authentic teachings of the Buddha offer a path based on sound reasoning and insight. They clearly point out the causes of our problems, and their remedies. They are accessible to the simplest people as well as to the most sophisticated. They contain a vast range of methods adapted to all sorts of human temperaments, needs and situations. Their main focus is to help bring about the elimination of suffering and develop peace, in the individual and in the world at large. And peace, they explain, is not something to be constructed outside. It must rather be discovered within, through deep and prolonged study of the scriptures and commentaries, and the putting into practice of the knowledge and instructions they contain. 

###  Tibetan: a vessel for wisdom 

A language, in its highest form, contains and conveys knowledge. The Tibetan language, in particular, contains a wealth of profound knowledge acquired over the generations and centuries by scholars and masters—not only Tibetan but Indian, too, for starting in the seventh century a vast body of knowledge discovered and developed during the golden age of Buddhism in India was systematically translated into Tibetan from Sanskrit and other languages, there to be preserved long after most of the original texts in India had been lost. 

###  About the Tibetan language 

[ ![Tibetan characters](/images/img_tibkakha_sm.jpg) ](/images/img_tibkakha.jpg)

Tibetan characters 

Tibetan began to be written in the 7th century with the establishment of an alphabet based on Indian Devanagari scripts by King Songtsen Gampo’s minister, Thönmi Sambhota. But the language itself is unrelated to the Sanskrit family of languages, belonging in a group by itself except for a distant relationship to Burmese. In the 8th and 9th centuries, the government sponsored translation into Tibetan of the whole range of Indian Buddhist literature, starting with the canonical scriptures (the sutras, and the other categories of the Buddha’s own discourses) and commentaries (the shastras, written by accomplished Buddhist masters), began in earnest (see next section). The written ‘classical Tibetan’ used for these translations underwent only a few modifications over the ensuing centuries. The original texts can be readily understood by educated Tibetans today, unlike most ancient languages (analogous to modern Italians reading Latin fluently). 

Spoken ‘Tibetan’, however, consists of a large number of dialects divided regionally, with an identifiable common base but sometimes so distinct as to be mutually incomprehensible. Pronunciation, as well as a large number of dialect words and forms, presumably evolved in very different directions. The Lhasa dialect is usually considered to be a sort of gold standard. The prefixed, suffixed, suprajoined and subjoined consonants that make Tibetan orthography quite daunting to the beginner are silent in present-day Lhasa dialect, or at most slightly modify the way the syllable is pronounced. But it is supposed that they were once pronounced in full, as some of them are today in the far-flung dialects of Ladakh in the far West, and Golok in the far East, of the Tibetan-speaking regions. 

Despite this initial complexity, it is not difficult to learn to read written Tibetan, either in its own script or transliterated using the system invented by Turrell Wylie and related systems (extended Wylie or EWTS, and ACIP). 

To learn to understand Tibetan, both written and spoken, is a more arduous undertaking (much useful information and many links can be found on the highly recommended site run by the [ Tibetan and Himalayan Digital Library (THDL) ](http://www.thlib.org/) . The effort will, however, be rewarded. For anyone wishing to study Buddhism in depth, a good understanding of Tibetan is arguably one of the most essential requisites—for the reasons set out in the section on Tibetan literature.
