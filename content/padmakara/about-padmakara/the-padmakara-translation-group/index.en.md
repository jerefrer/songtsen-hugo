Translators 

The Translation Group consists of translators and editors of different nationalities working under the direction of Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche. The translators, with qualifications in a number of disciplines, have all been studying and practising Tibetan Buddhism for many years, and most have completed one or more three-year retreat courses under the guidance of Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche and Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, two of the most respected Tibetan scholars of recent times. This experiential familiarity with the subject-matter of the texts they translate is essential to their understanding. 

Their guiding principles include: 

  * Starting by receiving transmission and explanation of the text from a qualified teacher. 
  * Careful, painstaking translation of the meaning, with extensive research and study where necessary, 
  * Submission of difficult points and doubts to competent teachers with a good knowledge of the text, 
  * Double-checking of the draft translation by at least one other translator 
  * Careful editing and rewriting to produce a clear, readable style, 
  * Final text proof-read and approved by a person who knows the subject and has a good command of the final language.
