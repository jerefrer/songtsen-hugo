##  The audio library: preservation of a unique audio heritage 

Over the last thirty years, numerous teachings have been recorded and now constitute an irreplaceable living transmission of the Buddhadharma. It has now become extremely urgent to convert analogue recordings on deteriorating magnetic media to digital form before they disappear without trace. 

This enormous task is now under way. 

##  preservation & digital conversion

Sound equipment 

Equipment has been set up which allows digital conversion from legacy audio media, in real time over long periods with a minimum of intervention. Where necessary, the recordings are ‘cleaned up’ using audio processing software. A database in which the recordings are catalogued and archived has been designed and established. 

Over 4.000 hours have already been digitalised. All of this has been made possible by through the hard work of an expert volunteer, using his own (and some donated) equipment. A project previously budgeted at € 10,000 in equipment and € 20,000 per year in running costs is generating almost no expenses. 

However, some relatively minor equipment needs remain. For more information, please contact Padmakara or send us an email at editions@padmakara.com
