Printing of Tibetan texts 

A large percentage of the funds generated from the sale of Padmakara books is dedicated to printing texts recently translated into Western languages or reprinting texts in their original Tibetan, particularly those that are most rare or treasured by our teachers. Furthermore, Padmakara must frequently reprint texts to maintain its stock. 

Padmakara funds must be distributed to various preservation projects, the funds allotted from book sales are not sufficient to cover costly printing expenses. Therefore, Padmakara relies on the contribution of individual donors for supplementary support. 

##  Printing new books 

Depending on the number of pages, the format, and the choice of cover and paper, the copy-editing, page layout and proof-reading costs of a typical new Padmakara book published in France would be around € 2,500 to € 5,000, while the actual printing costs of are of the order of € 5,000 to €10,000 for 1,500 copies. 

##  Reprinting existing books out of stock 

Here, the actual printing costs alone are, in theory, involved. However, in the case of older books of which the original typesetting films can no longer be used, old computer files need to be converted and the layout revised. Costs are typically around € 3,500 to €5,000 

##  Publishing of booklets & practice texts 

Padmakara’s practice texts (see [ online sales ](http://www.padmakara.com/) section) are now printed on demand in Padmakara’s own office. Costs are usually met by sales of the text concerned, but sometimes booklets are printed to be distributed free during a seminar, or for use in the retreats where the participants may not have the means to pay for all the texts they use. Sponsorship in such situations would be of the order of € 2 to € 6 per copy. 

##  Small print runs using digital printing 

Some book-length texts have been translated for the use of advanced practitioners and are not intended for public distribution. Their length and the number of copies required nevertheless justify their publication in book form. New digital technologies make it possible to print small runs of such works at reasonable cost. 

##  Publication of Tibetan texts in India 

Padmakara and Songtsen have on several occasions funded the publishing and printing of new or updated collections of Tibetan texts, in traditional, long, loose-leaf pecha format, or as Western-style bound books, sometimes in India or Nepal, and sometimes in Tibet and China, for world-wide distribution to monasteries, libraries, research institutions and individuals. Typical costs involved, for a 10 volume series, might be € 8,000.
