##  Scholarships for new translators: training a new generation 

There is a clear need for a new generation of translators who will eventually be able to take their place. They will need not only a good knowledge of Tibetan, but also fluency and writing skill in their native language. Another fundamental requirement is a good understanding and prolonged personal experience of Buddhist practice, preferably acquired in a traditional intensive retreat. 

Grants for one or several students over one or several years in the form of study scholarships would be a valuable investment in the future. 

The majority of Padmakara’s translators took part in the first or second three-year retreat courses in France, and are in their late fifties or early sixties. While they all hope to continue working for as many years as possible, there is a clear need for a new generation of translators who will eventually be able to take their place. 

They will need not only a good knowledge of Tibetan, but also fluency and writing skill in their native language. Another fundamental requirement is a good understanding and prolonged personal experience of Buddhist practice, preferably acquired in a traditional intensive retreat. 

Many of those who join and complete the three-year retreat programmes organized by the Association du Centre d’Études de Chanteloube develop an interest in the texts and a working knowledge of Tibetan. The much larger number of people who will eventually complete the Chanteloube Parallel retreat courses will also be well qualified to start training as translators. 

Depending on their existing knowledge, most such prospective trainee translators would then need to study Tibetan as a first step. This could be at one of the excellent intensive courses now offered at Tibet University in Lhasa, or at one of the many university courses elsewhere. Existing members of the Translation Group have also proposed creating a course in the techniques and resources specific to this kind of translation. 

Grants for one or several students over one or several years in the form of study scholarships would be a valuable investment in the future. They would enable trainees to study at one of the courses mentioned, and would then cover a period of apprenticeship, perhaps working on a text of which a translation exists already in another language. 

Qualified candidates are invited to contact Padmakara, as is anyone interested in helping to fund trainee study scholarships.
