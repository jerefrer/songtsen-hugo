##  Administration: sponsoring administrative staff salaries 

Padmakara depends to a large extent on sponsorship to cover the salaries of the three existing members of the administrative staff, for ethical as well as financial reasons. The administrative workload includes receiving orders, billing, preparing shipments, managing book printing, distribution and stock-keeping, copying audio CDs, laying-out and printing booklets, accounting, communication, dealing with on-site sales, answering queries, and many other tasks. 

Padmakara has recently taken on a third, part-time administrative staff member as the workload is now more than can be handled by two people. One staff salary is covered by a grant from the Tsadra Foundation. Another is partially funded by a system whereby many individual donors make small regular payments via the Fondation Padmasambhava, but the shortfall needs to be made up.
