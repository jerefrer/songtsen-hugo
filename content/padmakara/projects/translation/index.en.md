##  The translation of Tibetan texts 

The translation of Tibetan Buddhist texts requires not only familiarity with the language but also a deep knowledge of the subject. The task involves extensive research, correction, clarification, style improvement and re-reading. Members of the Padmakara Translation Group must therefore work in close collaboration with Tibetan lamas, scholars and learned khenpos (monks with knowledge superior to a PhD equivalent in Buddhist philosophy). Such a process takes far too long for any idea of ‘profitability’ to be considered. The only way to ensure that the translators can carry out this work properly is by a system of external grants. 

Padmakara’s translators receive no income from book sales or royalties. In the case of nine full-time translators in France translating from Tibetan into French and English, their work is sponsored by grants from foundations and private donors. Other translators, both in France and other countries, volunteer their work, which is done in time off from their jobs. 

The translators work according to contract, and are paid in instalments. To give an idea of the sums involved: a modest living subsidy in France, including social charges and contributions, amounts to about € 1,700 per month. 

One translator’s grant represents an annual budget of between € 16,000 and € 24,000, depending on the hours worked and the level of experience. 

There is no shortage of texts (chosen by Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche) which remain to be translated. Some translation projects are entirely new ones. Others involve a text already researched and translated into either English or French being translated into other languages—which can be completed much more rapidly.
