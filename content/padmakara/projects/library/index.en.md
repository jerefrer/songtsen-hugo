##  The library project: a facility for text preservation, research, & translation 

Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and his family preserve one of the most extensive collections of Tibetan texts in the world – many of which are now the last remaining copies. It contains many unique books, some of which are more than ten centuries old. It has become an urgent priority to create a facility to properly store these texts, where they can be of service to scholars, translators and to the interested public. Providing access to texts that are now virtually unavailable, the facility will undoubtedly function as one of the most important Tibetan Buddhist research centres in the world. The library will also house ancient and original texts in a climate-controlled environment where texts will not be damaged by dust, dampness, or other deteriorating factors.

Collection of books to be properly stored 

Kyabje Kangyur Rinpoche, a great scholar, accorded the greatest importance to books. When he left Tibet with his family, his primary concern was to take with him numerous rare and precious texts. Owing to his remarkable care and foresight, Songtsen now possesses one of the most extensive collections of Tibetan texts in the world – many of which are now the last remaining copies. (See also Rescuing and preserving texts: An extensive collection of texts in France) 

Currently, these texts are housed in several different buildings in Dordogne, in less than ideal conditions. They are insufficiently protected from changes in temperature and humidity, and from dust, micro-organisms etc., and cannot be easily accessed and studied. A facility in which these rare and precious texts can be properly stored, and where they can be of service to scholars, translators and to the interested public, is now an urgent priority. 

###  Project details 

With Kangyur Rinpoche’s wishes in mind, Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche have planned a new library building providing optimum conditions for the safe storage and conservation of these works, as well as easier access to them. The same building would also house offices for Padmakara’s administration, translators, researchers and technicians, a meeting room, an audio and image processing studio, audio archive, accommodation for visiting scholars, and storage for Padmakara’s stock of books. 

Several sites have been proposed, some of which would require land to be purchased. The building will be of local style and materials. Fuller details will be posted once the architectural plan has been finalised and more detailed costing has been done. Equipping the building is expected to take up a considerable proportion of the budget.Financial requirements 

Provisional budget: € 4 million (of which € 150,000 has already been donated)
