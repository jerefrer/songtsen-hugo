Siddhartha is the branch of Songtsen dedicated to the help of children in need, particularly children in the Himalayan regions. Its aim is to give them access to an education within the environment of their own cultural and spiritual traditions: providing with schooling while allowing and encouraging them to retain their own cultural identity.

“Siddhartha” means “the one who accomplished his goal.” It was the name of the Indian prince who, at the age of 36, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha. Since 1980, we have continued to “pursue our goal”, assisting in the education of hundreds of children of deprived families in the Himalayan region, whether they are Tibetan refugees or belong to other ethnicities. It is an immense task, but slowly and surely, Siddhartha has grown beyond its original mission to help the children of Orgyen Kunzang Chökhorling, the monastery founded by Kangyur Rinpoche in Darjeeling, and is now supporting on a regular basis other institutions (schools and monasteries) in India, Nepal, and Bhutan
