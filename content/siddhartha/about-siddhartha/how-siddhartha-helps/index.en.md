In the deprived populations of the Himalayan region, children are the most vulnerable and the most in need of help. As has been the case for hundreds of years, the future of Tibetan culture and Tibetan Buddhism rests primarily with the younger generations, and depends on the opportunities provided for them to study, uphold, and later transmit, their tradition. 

The monasteries, schools and other institutions founded by the exiled Tibetan community offer the best possible conditions for children to live in decent surroundings and to receive an education that respects and maintains their cultural and spiritual heritage. Nevertheless, owing to the difficulties of life in exile, these institutions are unable to function without international aid.

It is for this reason that Siddhartha concentrates on the upkeep and education of children and young people living in monasteries and educational institutes, ensuring that they have all the basic necessities of food, clothing, shelter, and instruction. KRF Development, another branch of Songtsen, provides for the construction and maintenance of buildings. 

Although Siddhartha was initially founded to address the needs of Tibetan refugee children, its assistance is not confined to the Tibetan community. Every year, Siddhartha undertakes various projects to help children of all impoverished Himalayan communities. Many of these communities have no access to schools or other essential resources, and in some cases lack even a proper water supply. Siddhartha works with KRF Development to help establish local schools and to improve the general conditions of life. 

Siddhartha is a branch of the Association du Centre dâ€™Etudes de Chnateloube, a non-profit organisation registered in France under the law of 1901.
