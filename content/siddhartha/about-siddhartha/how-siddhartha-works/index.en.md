As a means to supporting monasteries and other institutions in need, Siddhartha has created a system of sponsorship. For the price of approximately 1.5 € per day, it is possible to provide for a child’s future. 

Rather than creating a personalized sponsorship system aiming to establish special links between the donors and their sponsored child, Siddhartha sponsorships provide an equal and fair distribution of funds within the school or monastery. A full sponsorship represents the amount required for the education and upkeep of one child. However, the communal nature of life in the monastery means that all resources are shared equally. For this reason, the funds collected by Siddhartha are sent to the officials in charge of the institutions concerned and are used to cover the needs of all the children together, providing them with food, clothing, and health care. The children are informed of the origin of the funds but without creating relationships between children and sponsors on a one-to-one basis. 

Such a system, in which one child may profit more than another would create inequalities incompatible with the communal environment in which the children are brought up. Sponsorship is assigned to monasteries according to priority.
