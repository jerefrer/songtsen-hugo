Pema Wangyal Rinpoche with a street child in Kathmandu, Nepal 

  * To help Tibetan children and the children of other cultural backgrounds, particularly those who are most in need: orphaned or abandoned children and the children of families too poor to provide them with an adequate upbringing. 
  * To supply shelter, food, clothing, and medical care. 
  * To make possible access to primary and secondary education within a traditional setting so that the children can later choose either to pursue a trade in the world or to continue with more advanced studies in the monastery. 
  * To finance carers and teaching staff and to provide educational materials. 
  * In collaboration with KRF Development to provide for the construction and upkeep of schools and boarding accommodation.
