title: "Shechen Orgyen Chözong"

Siddhartha provides support on a yearly basis to the community of 42 nuns of the monastery of Sisinang, which is located near Thimpu, the capital of Bhutan. In a society still marked by a strong bias in favour of the male monastic tradition, institutions that allow women to study and practice the Dharma are rare, despite the fact that there is no shortage of young girls who have deep aspirations in that direction. Shechen Orgyen Chödzong Nunnery at Sisinang is one of the rare establishments providing such facilities. 

Siddhartha is in search of funding that will allow it to increase its support of this worthy project.
