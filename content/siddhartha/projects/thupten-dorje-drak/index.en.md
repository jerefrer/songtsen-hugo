The great monastery of Dorje Drak (“The Indestructible Rock”) in Tibet was one of the six great monasteries of the Nyingma School. It was famous for being the seat of the tradition of the great “Northern Treasure” (jang-ter). Following the Chinese invasion of Tibet, the monastery was completely destroyed and has only been partly restored.

Kyabje Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche, the head of the Jang-Ter lineage, is the present throne-holder of Dorje Drak. He is the holder of the Kahma and Terma lineages and is one of the foremost holders of the lineage of monastic ordination in the Nyingma school, of which he assumed the leadership following the death of Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche.After the destruction of Dorje Drak in Tibet, Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche made the strong aspiration to create a Dorje Drak monastery in exile in order to preserve and transmit the teachings of the Jang-Ter tradition.

New Dorje Drak Monastery in India 

Thanks to the efforts of his monks, and working with the officials of the Indian government and the office of H.H. the Dalai Lama, he founded a small monastery in the Tibetan refugee settlement of Shimla in the north of India. 

As with many Tibetan monasteries in exile, the conditions at Thupten Dorje Drak are often very difficult. The monastery is isolated and lacks the regular support of a local community of the kind that was a natural feature of life in Tibet. In any case, the Tibetan lay community in exile is itself impoverished and has great difficulty in establishing a self-sufficient way of life. There are now almost 100 monks in residence at Thupten Dorje Drak, many of them children, studying and practicing under the direction of Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche. With the gradual increase over the years in the number of monks entering the monastery, the monastic buildings are now too small to accommodate them adequately.

Kitchen of the Monastery 

For this reason, and also with the desire to help support this important and endangered lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, Siddhartha has endeavoured to gather donations in order to bring much needed help to the monastery and its various projects. These include the extension of the monastery buildings, providing a new kitchen, sanitary facilities, classrooms, a library and a temple.

Even more urgent are the daily needs of the monks in terms of food, clothing, and equipment. Conditions at Dorje Drak are rudimentary even by Indian standards. Comfort is minimal and the sanitary conditions are in urgent need of attention. It is essential to provide at least the basic necessities, supplying the children with food, clothing, and health care. In fact, Dorje Drak is in need of roughly twice the amount that Siddhartha is able to supply at the present time. 

In order to cover the expenses of the monastery, especially with regard to the young monks newly arriving, Siddhartha is seeking regular contributions, grants and sponsorships.
