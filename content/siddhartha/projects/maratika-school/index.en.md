Maratika is a village in the Khotang District in Nepal and home to an exceptionally impoverished community. Known as Haleshi in the local language it lies approximately 185 kilometers to the south-wesat of Mt Everest. It is however a special place, associated with Guru Padmasambhava and his attainment of the siddhi of everlasting life.
