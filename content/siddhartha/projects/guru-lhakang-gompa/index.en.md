The monastery of Guru Lhakhang 

Located in Gangtok, Sikkim, Guru Lhakhang (literally the Temple of the Guru) owes its name to the enormous statue in its temple of the great master Padmasambhava, usually referred to as Guru Rinpoche, who established Buddhism in Tibet in the 8th century. Early in the 1980s, His Holiness the Dalai Lama entrusted the supervision of the monastery to Kungo Nyima Zangpo, who later took on the management of OKC in Darjeeling. Guru Lhakhang is located at the entrance of Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. At several hours journey from Darjeeling and linked by a major road, this small monastery is closely associated with OKC.

Young monk 

Over many years, Kungo Nyima Zangpo worked to restore the monastery buildings and temple, which had been in a very dilapidated state. He did a great deal to improve the living conditions of the young monks. Unfortunately, he died suddenly in November 2000 before being able to complete his work. In recognition of his kindness, the monastery performed a week of ceremonies in his honour. 

The financial administration of this small monastery is now dependent on OKC in Darjeeling. 

In order to cover the expenses of the monastery, especially with regard to the young monks newly arriving, Siddhartha is seeking regular contributions, grants and sponsorships.
