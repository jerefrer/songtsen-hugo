Street children in Boudhanath, Nepal 

In 2005, Pema Wangyal Rinpoche inaugurated a project to help save the street children in Boudhanath on the outskirts of Kathmandu, Nepal. 

To help him achieve his aim, Siddhartha has joined forces with the Pegasus School, an organization inspired by the spirit of compassion. The Pegasus school buildings are in Boudhanath, but the living quarters for the children are situated outside the town in a quieter and more salubrious part of the Kathmandu valley. The Pegasus School already provides education and housing for hundreds of children. KRF Development is trying to raise funds in order to buy more land on which to construct new buildings so that more street children can be received.

At the present moment, Siddhartha is directly sponsoring the schooling of more than twenty street children, not only in the Pegasus school, but also in other institutions around Kathmandu. 

To cover the expenses of tuition and board, Siddhartha is in search of regular funding.
