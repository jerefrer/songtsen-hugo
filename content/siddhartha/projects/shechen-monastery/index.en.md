Shechen Monastery, Nepal 

For several decades now, Siddhartha has been sending regular donations to Shechen Monastery, which at the moment houses a community of over 300 monks—a number that is inceasing yearly, despite the fact that the present buildings are already filled to their maximum capacity.

Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche 

When a child applies to enter the monastery, the abbot, Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche, meets with his parents or nearest relatives. Since Rinpoche is not in a position to accept everyone who applies, he is forced to consider the merits of every case. Sometimes it is the boy himself (usually between six and seven years old) who spontaneously wishes to become a monk. Sometimes it is the boy’s parents who wish to place in the monastery a child that they themselves are unable to raise.

In the monastery, the young monks pass through three levels of study. First, there is elementary tuition for boys of between 12 and 15 years. The content of these studies depends on the tuition that the children may or may not have already received. Following this, the monks spend two to three years studying the monastery rituals. This involves the making of tormas, training in sacred dance and in the playing of the musical instruments used in the temple. Finally, they enter the Shedra, the college of philosophical studies where they acquire a high level of training. 

At the present time, Siddhartha sponsorships cover only a small part of the tuition of children at the elementary level. Siddhartha is looking for regular funds in order to increase its aid.
