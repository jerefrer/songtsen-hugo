Orgyen Kunzang Chökhorling Monastery, Darjeeling 

Siddhartha ensures the regular upkeep of the monastery in Darjeeling founded by Kangyur Rinpoche. OKC is as much an orphanage as a monastery. At the present time, its community numbers sixty members, principally children and young adults. 

The children, who are usually in great need, come from various Himalayan communitites. Many have no family or have been abandoned; and some come from families too poor to keep them. Regardless of their background and ethnic origin, the monastery treats all its children equally and provides them with all necessities: food, clothing, shelter, medical care and so on. When parents ask the monastery to take their child, they usually offer a donation, which, owing to their circumstances, is usually very small. For the most part, it is up to the monastery to provide for the needs of the children. This places a burden on the monastery which is often difficult to manage.

Given that the monastery depends almost entirely on the offerings of well-wishers, it is easy to see that, in providing education and care for all its children, it is often faced with major difficulties. As in all monasteries, the children live simply and frugally. In general, they have two sets of clothes consisting of a shantab (monastic tunic), a shirt, and a sen (a monastic shawl), red, brown or yellow in colour. Annually, just before the Tibetan New Year, which usually falls in February according to the Tibetan lunar calendar, the monastery provides every child with a new set of robes. 

The children do not take full monastic vows before the age of 19. When that time comes, they are free to decide whether or not they will receive monastic ordination, thus beginning a life-long commitment to the monastic life. Those who decide not to do so are free to return to life in the world. Throughout their early life in the monastery, the children receive not only a practical education adapted to the conditions of the society in which they live, they also receive a profound spiritual formation that will shape their lives for the years to come.

The educational curriculum in the monastery provides training in the traditional Tibetan arts: painting, calligraphic transcription, sculpture and other skills. This not only helps to ensure the survival and development of Tibetan cultural traditions, but also provides the growing children with skills that will be useful to them should they wish to embrace an active career in the world. 

###  Building and maintenance work

Repairing the roof 

The humid climate in Darjeeling continues to play havoc with the flat roof of the monastery. By September 2007, work was urgently needed to protect the monastery from damage. A temporary solution was found consisting of the construction of a tarpaulin covered bamboo frame large enough to shelter the entire roof. The next step is to find a more permanent solution to protect the monastery by rendering the roof water-tight. The monastery is currently considering the options available.

A precarious solution to the problems of water shortage 

The problem of water-storage has also had to be reconsidered. With the passage of time, the situation in Darjeeling has become steadily more difficult. Many institutions, including the monastery, are obliged to have their water brought in by truck. This often poses problems. Water shortage is critical in the dry season during winter. It is not so much that the region lacks water but that the water supply system in Darjeeling has never been enlarged or modernized since its installation at the time of the British Raj. It has never kept pace with the dramatic increase in population. While waiting for the renovation of the water-supply network, the best interim solution will be the construction of maximum capacity cisterns in which to collect rain water, which falls abundantly during the monsoon. The monastery is planning to build such a cistern as a means of ensuring the health and hygiene of the children.
