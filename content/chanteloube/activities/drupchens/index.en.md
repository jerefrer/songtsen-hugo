Three-dimensional Mandala 

A drupchen is an elaborate ritual meditation and group practice performed 24 hours a day for 9 days. The practice is led by one or more lamas and a group of monks and/or yogis. The participants generally practise during the day sessions and take shifts during the night sessions so that there is a never-ending flow of mantra recitation and meditation practice. 

Drup means accomplishment and chen signifies great or vast. The drupchen is a remarkably sophisticated tradition with intricate ceremonial procedures performed by the lamas and monks, including sacred dances. Drupchens have many profound benefits, including helping to purify or prevent obstacles and contributing to peace and harmony in the world. 

Beginning in the summer of 1996, and every summer for the following nine years, Chanteloube had the good fortune to be able to organize a drupchen in the Dordogne, alowing many people to take part in this powerful practice in the presence of several great masters of our tradition. We are particularly grateful to Neten Choling Rinpoche and to Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche, together with the monks of their monastery, for guiding and undertaking this important practice. 

Chanteloube contributes to Drupchens in Kyabje Trulshik Rinpocheâ€™s monastery in Nepal; in Bir, India; and in Bhutan.
