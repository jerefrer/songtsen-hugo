##  Traditionnal studies 

Buddhism includes a vast wealth of philosophical and metaphysical teaching, the aim of which is to foster a more effective understanding of the mind and the phenomenal world. Chanteloube organises advanced courses based on the principal Buddhist texts. The courses focus on the essential aspects of Buddhist philosophy, expounded according to the teachings of different traditions and the Nyingma tradition in particular. 

In recent years, for example, in-depth teachings have been given by Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche on Chandrakirti’s Madhyamakavatara and Asanga’s Uttaratantra Shastra; by Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche, Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche and Khenchen Pema Sherab on Jigme Lingpa’s Treasury of Precious Qualities; by Khenchen Pema Sherab on Shantarakshita’s Ornament to the Middle Way and Nagarjuna’s Letter to a Friend, and by Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche on Mipham Rinpoche’s Sword of Wisdom.

##  Seminars & traditional studies 

Throughout the year, and in particular during the summer, programmes are organized which cover basic Buddhist teachings, meditation and their application in everyday life. The courses are taught by Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche, as well as by other lamas regularly invited to teach at Chanteloube.
