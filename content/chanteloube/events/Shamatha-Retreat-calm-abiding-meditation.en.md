We are pleased to announce that our teachers have agreed to lead a three-day retreat on the practice of calm abiding meditation (shamatha).
This retreat is open to all, beginners or long-time practitioners, but especially to those who wish to eventually begin a cycle of regular retreats like the ones our teachers have been leading for several years.
This retreat will take place at Domaine de Lembrun, 47110 Le-Temple-Sur-Lot. It will begin at 9:30 am on , Saturday September 16, 2023, and will end on Monday, September 18, 2023, around 5:00 pm.
It is essential to attend the entire retreat.

Limited number of places – Prior registration required – No registration on site
