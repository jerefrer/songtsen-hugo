We are delighted to announce that, in response to a request from our teachers, His Holiness Sakya Trinchen Rinpoche has agreed to honour us with his visit this summer.

This event will take place in two parts: three days of teachings and transmissions, and three days of consecration of the stupas at Chanteloube.
