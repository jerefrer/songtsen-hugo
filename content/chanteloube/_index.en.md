##  The Centre d’Études de Chanteloube 

The Association du Centre d’Études de Chanteloube (A.C.E.C.), is the branch of Songtsen dedicated to the practice and study of Tibetan Buddhism. 

Its principal activity is the organization of the traditional three-year retreat. These retreats, which normally last about 42 months, are designed to create a protective environment in which practitioners can concentrate on the essential features of the Buddhist path: study, reflection and meditation, presented according to the teachings of various lineages, but mainly that of the Nyingma tradition. 

The Association draws its inspiration from the life and work of Kangyur Rinpoche and was officially founded in 1980 under the spiritual guidance of Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche and Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, two major figures of the Nyingma tradition, the most ancient school of Tibetan Buddhism. 

Throughout its existence, the Centre d’Etudes de Chanteloube has been fortunate in welcoming many eminent masters. 

###  The place

In the heart of Dordogne, not far from some of the world’s most ancient prehistoric sites (Lascaux, Les Eyzies, Le Moustier, La Madeleine), on the long ridge of the Côte de Jor, overlooking the valley of the Vézère, are the houses of Dudjom Rinpoche and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, which they visited frequently and where they gave many teachings. 

It is in this area, blessed by their wonderful presence, that the Association’s activities have grown and flourished. 

Not far from the Côte de Jor, the old farmhouse of Chanteloube, in its secluded valley, has been transformed into a retreat centre. 

For over fiften years, La Sonnerie was the seat Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche in Europe. It is now the venue for the Summer programme of teachings organized by the Association, as well as for various ceremonies celebrated throughout the Tibetan year. For more than twenty years, many of the greatest lamas of all the lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, including His Holiness the Dalai Lama, have expounded the Buddhadharma here. 

The Association office is now located at La Bicanderie, also on the Côte de Jor.
