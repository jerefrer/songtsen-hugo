Kangyur Rinpoche 

The origins of Chanteloube go back to the early 1960s, when a small group of Westerners met Kangyur Rinpoche. At that time, Kangyur Rinpoche was living with his family in Darjeeling, surrounded by an entire library of precious books that he had brought with him from Tibet, thus saving them from destruction during the Chinese invasion. 

In those years, was difficult for most Europeans to obtain visas allowing them to stay and practice for any length of time in Darjeeling. Kangyur Rinpoche therefore accepted the invitation of his students to teach and establish the Dharma in Europe. However, in 1972, Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche, who was living in nearby Kalimpong, visited the West for the first time. Kangyur Rinpoche was well aware that Dudjom Rinpoche was a master of very great accomplishment, for they had both been disciples of the same root teacher, Thrinlé Jampa Jungné, Jedrung Rinpoche of Riwoche. Kangyur Rinpoche therefore sent his eldest son, Pema Wangyal Rinpoche, to request Dudjom Rinpoche to include France in his itinerary and to give teachings to a group of students living there. And so it happened that Dudjom Rinpoche first visited Dordogne and, in 1976, consecrated the land of Chanteloube.

Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, and Trulshik Rinpoche 

Also very close to Kangyur Rinpoche was another great master, Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Along with Kalu Rinpoche and Bokar Rinpoche, he had received the Nyingma Gyübum and the entire Taksham collection, as well as other rare transmissions from Kangyur Rinpoche. And Kangyur Rinpoche in turn received important transmissions, such as the Nyingtik Yabzhi, from Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Now Kangyur Rinoche died in January 1975, and was unable to fulfill his wish to visit the West. In the same year therefore, Pema Wangyal Rinpoche requested Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche to come to the West and to give teachings to Kangyur Rinpoche’s students. They arrived in Paris on the 16 December 1975, embarking on a momentous journey that was to include not only France, but also Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, England, Canada and the United States. It was during this visit that Pema Wangyal Rinpoche accepted the request to establish a study centre for the furtherance of his father’s activities and to create an environment where his students might receive teachings from Dudjom Rinpoche and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. So it was that a centre of studies was founded in Dordogne at Chanteloube. 

The land of the future retreat centre was blessed and consecrated by Dudjom Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse and also by the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, whom Kangyur Rinpoche had also requested to visit Dordogne during his journey to the West in order to teach this students there.

Jetsun Jampa Chökyi 

Whereas Kangyur had been unable to visit the West, his wife, Jetsün Jampa Chökyi, known to us all as Amala or “Mother”, settled in Dordogne with the rest of her family in 1980. Here she spent most of her time in retreat, an was an inspiration to all who knew her through the power of her presence, her humility and gentle kindness. 

After his first visit in 1972, Dudjom Rinpoche regularly taught in the Dordogne until his death in 1987. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche taught at Chanteloube from 1975 to 1990 and in the course of those fifteen years visited Dordogne no less than 17 times. It is thanks to the extraordinary aspirations of these teachers that very great masters continue to come d teach in the Dordogne—such as Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche, one of the most senior teachers of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, and a holder of all the lineages of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and Dudjom Rinpoche. 

Chanteloube draws its inspiration from Tibet’s non-sectarian (ri-mé) movement and is open to all Buddhist traditions.
