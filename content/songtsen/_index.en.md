---

*Songtsen* is the overall name given to the various projects and activities undertaken by Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and his family since the early 1980s.

The goal of Songtsen is to rescue, preserve and make accessibe the cultural and spiritual traditions of the Tibetan people. Songtsen’s work is inspired by the extraordinary compassionate activity of Kangyur Rinpoche, one of the greatest Tibetan Lamas of the 20th century. It has been active for more than thirty years in aid projects and cultural activities initiated and pursued by a team of Tibetans and Westerners.
