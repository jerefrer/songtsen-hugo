Kangyur Rinpoche 

Kyabje Kangyur Rinpoche, Longchen Yeshe Dorje, was born in Eastern Tibet in 1898, the year of the Earth Dog, and began studying the Dharma and practising from an early age. His root guru was Jedrung Rinpoche, Trinle Jampa Jungne, of Riwoche monastery, famous for its non-sectarian approach and its annual festival in which its two main colleges, one Nyingmapa and the other belonging to the Taklung Kagyu tradition, used to practise together. Although Kangyur Rinpoche was never enthroned while still a child as an incarnate lama in accordance with Tibetan tradition, he was in due course recognized as an emanation of Namkha’i Nyingpo himself, one of the closest disciples of Guru Rinpoche. Kangyur Rinpoche was thus a tertön and revealed many important spiritual treasures, some while he was still very young. 

Kangyur Rinpoche’s life falls broadly into two periods. In fulfilment of his teachers’ wishes, he devoted the first part of his life to study and practice.It is said that after receiving the empowerment of Manjushri from Mipham Rinpoche, he was able to memorize any text at a single reading. Even as a child, he displayed an extraordinary diligence in study, often reading late into the night by the light of no more than the glowing tip of an stick of incense. He became a scholar of unsurpassed learning, not only in the whole range of the teachings of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism, but also in a wide variety of practical subjects including medicine. Combining his studies with the perfect observance of monastic discipline, he engaged in profound meditative practice in the course a number of long retreats, thus crowning his immense scholarship with extraordinary realization and yogic accomplishment. He was thus able to contribute in no small measure to every aspect of life in his monastery of Riwoche where he held several posts of high responsibility. 

Kangyur Rinpoche’s devotion to the Dharma, coupled with complete disregard for status of any sort, led him to abandon the positions of honour which he occupied in the monastery and to take up the life of a wandering hermit. He visited many different places in east Tibet and received intructions from many teachers. 

Although study and practice remained at all times a dominant feature of his personality, the second period of Kangyur Rinpoche’s life was marked by his extraordinary humanity and his service of others. He cherished four activities above all: care for the chronically sick (he was a skilled physician), care for the aged, care for orphaned children, and the preservation and propagation of Dharma. Teaching and transmission was one of Kangyur’s major activities, notably the reading transmission of the Kangyur, or Tibetan Canon, the vast collection of over one hundred volumes of the translated sutras and tantras. Indeed Kangyur Rinpoche’s own name was given to him in recognition of the fact that he gave the transmission of this vast collection of texts no fewer than twenty-four times.

Kangyur Rinpoche also devoted his energies to the restauration of monasteries and stupas. Here as elsewhere, his involvement in such work was not confined simply to the providing of inspiring leadership and funding. On the contrary, he often displayed an surprising skill and dexterity in the most physical and practical aspects of the work itself.

In the last twenty years of his life, the preservation of the Dharma became Kangyur Rinpoche’s principal concern. Foreseeing the disaster to come, and realising that the future of Buddhism in Tibet was threatened, he left for India with his consort and family, taking with him a large library of many rare and important texts that otherwise would have been lost forever. Eventually establishing himself in Darjeeling, he took great pains to ensure that the Buddhist teachings be transmitted to future generations, founding a monastery where Tibetan children could receive a traditional education from an early age.

Kyabje Kangyur Rinpoche passed away in the year of the Wood Hare (1975). Although he never fulfilled his expressed wish to visit Europe and America, it was important to him that the Buddhadharma be established in the West. He gave unsparingly of his time to visiting Westerners, a number of whom spent months practising under his guidance. At his personal behest, several great masters, notably Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche and Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche founded the retreat centre Chanteloube in Dordogne. And it is thanks to the activities of his consort Jetsün Jampa Chökyi and his sons: Taklung Tsetrul Pema Wangyal Rinpoche, Rangdröl Rinpoche, and Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche, and through the selfless and untiring labours of his three daughters: Rigdzin Chödrön, Jetsün Yangchen Chödzom, and Chökyi Dorje, that many Westerners have been able to embark upon the study and practice of the Dharma, some of them in the traditional three-year retreat.
