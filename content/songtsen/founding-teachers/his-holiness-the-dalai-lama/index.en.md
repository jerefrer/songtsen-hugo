His Holiness Tendzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He was born on July 6, 1935 in Takster, a small village in the north-east of Tibet. At the age of two, he was recognized as the incarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama. “Dalai Lama” is a title first divised by the Mongol leader Altan Khan as a name for the third Dalai Lama Sonam Gyatso. Literally it means “Ocean Lama” and is perhaps a reference to the vast, oceanic, qualities of wisdom and compassion that the Dalai Lamas are believed to possess. The Dalai Lamas are considered to be manifestations of Avalokiteshvara (Tib. Chenrezik), the Bodhisattva of Compassion. 

A master of prodigious erudition, His Holiness is universally respected as one of the greatest living exponents of the Buddhist Tradition. His seat in exile is in Dharamsala, in the North Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. He travels frequently and gives teachings all over the world but when at home he grants public audiences and blessings every week.
