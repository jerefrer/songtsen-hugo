Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche and Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpotche in Dordogne, France 

Chanteloube’s founding teachers are Kyabje Kangyur Rinpoche, Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche and Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who are considered as three of the greatest luminaries of Tibetan Buddhism of the 20th century. 

Like all Tibetan Buddhists, we consider His Holiness the Dalai Lama as one of our main teachers. Not only do we rely on his wisdom and compassion, but also we are dedicated to supporting, in every way possible, his efforts to further human values and welfare in general, to uphold Tibetan Buddhism in particular, and to further the cause of Tibet.
