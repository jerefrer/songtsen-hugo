Jetsün Jampa Chökyi was born on the 30th day of the 12th month of the year of the Water Dog (1922). Her father, Sonam Tobyal was of the Do-Gön family and a descendent of King Trisong Detsen. Her mother, Dekyi Nordzom, belonged, on the side of her father Rinpong Desid, to the Zanri Sarpa, the sixth family or tribe of Tibet.

Jetsün Jampa Chökyi’s education was entrusted to several tutors, but from her early years, she was powerfully drawn to meditation and spiritual practice, and everyone liked her because of her kindness and compassion. At the age of seven, she met her first teacher, Drakshung Rinpoche, and received from him instructions on mind-training and the preliminary practices. At the age of eight, she entered the nunnery of Samten Yangtse in Nyemo and came to be greatly admired for her renunciation and meditative practice. Whenever she encountered the suffering of others, whether human beings or animals, she did all she could to alleviate their trouble. She protected animals from harm or slaughter and would regularly make offerings for the food, clothing and shelter of people in difficulty. Often she would empty her own store of grain to provide for the poor.

Owing to their high social rank, her parents were frequently obliged to visit the southern and eastern provinces of Tibet, and in her youth Jetsün Jampa Chökyi often accompanied them. Thanks to these journeys she had the occasion to meet, and study with, many great teachers. Before he died, Drakshung Rinpoche told his young disciple that she would soon meet her root teacher with whom she had been connected for many lives. And so it was that in 1936, when she was fourteen years old, Jetsün Jampa Chökyi went on pilgrimage to the holy places in the south of Tibet. When she reached Samye Chimpu, she learned from one of the khenpos of Dzogchen monastery (who was to become the father of the sixth Dzogchen Rinpoche) that the transmission of the entire collection of the Buddha’s teaching (the Kangyur) was to be given by a most eminent master called Kangyur Rinpoche. The khenpo strongly advised her to attend and receive the transmission, which was as rare as it was precious. When she heard Kangyur Rinpoche’s name, her mind was filled with joy, and she knew immediately that she must meet him at all costs. She therefore sent a few of her attendants and one of her nuns home to gather enough provisions to last them throughout the time of the transmission.

According to the Khenpo’s advice and as preparation for these transmissions, Jetsün Jampa Chökyi completed the preliminaries and meditation upon the Guru sadhana called Ocean of Jewels (Norbu Gyatso), according to the tradition of Padma Lingpa. During the time of her practice, in this place made sacred by Guru Padmsambhava, she experienced many highly auspicious signs. One night she had a dream in which Guru Padmasambhava, the main deity in the sadhana of the Ocean of Jewels, transformed into a most impressive and powerful lama. When she woke up, she had a powerful feeling that she had met this teacher already many times, though she could not say when. Later, when she saw Kangyur Rinpoche arriving in Samye Chimpu, she realized that he was the master she had seen in her dream. She felt that she had known Kangyur Rinpoche for many lifetimes. She received his permission to attend the Kangyur transmission and during that time she received many other important initiations. Later, in 1938, Jetsün Jampa Chökyi received the getsulma ordination, and following Kangyur Rinpoche’s guidance, she engaged in advanced meditative practices in various sacred places. During that time also, and over a period of several years, she continued to study with her private tutors, becoming highly accomplished in the arts of poety, music, grammar, dance, sculpture, and painting. At this time also she served Kangyur Rinpoche’s mother in Nyemo.

In 1941, Kangyur Rinpoche’s mother passed away. Taking on himself her unfufilled wish to go on pilgrimage, Kangyur Rinpoche decided to visit the holy places of India and Nepal. He set off in the company of many of his disciples and Jetsün Jampa Chökyi had the great good fortune to be included in the party. Travelling through Sikkim, the made their way to Kalimpong, Patna, Vaishali, Nalanda, Udhampur, Rajgir, Vulture Peak, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, Kushinagara, and then north to Nepal where they visited Bodhanath, Swayambhunath, Namo Buddha and Lumbini. Then they went south again into India, visiting Sravasti, Sankisa, Delhi, Sanchi, Ajanta, and Allora. They then returned to Delhi and continued on to Amritsar, Baijnath, Shimla, Mandi and Tso Pema (Rewalsar). While at Tso Pema, Kangyur Rinpoche went into retreat for several months and it was here that he composed the sadhana of the Shower of Blessings. Then from Manali, the party returned to Tibet, travelling on foot to Kailash, then on to Shigatse and finally back to Nyemo. The entire journey took over a year, during which time Kangyur Rinpoche experienced many visions and discovered several terma or spiritual treasures.

In 1943, Kangyur Rinpoche and Jetsün Jampa Chökyi married and together they had a family of six children. She continued to serve Kangyur Rinpoche and promote his activities until her very last days. She passed away in Portugal on the 25th day of the twelfth month of the Wood Bird year (15 February, 2004) , at the age of 84. Although exceedingly humble, Jetsün Jampa Chökyi inspired everyone who met her through the wisdom and compassion that seemed at all times to radiate from her. Her whole life was devoted to the study and practice of the Dharma. Many high lamas and indeed all who knew her regarded her as a truly accomplished practitioner. Through her kindness and compassion, she changed the lives of all who had the good fortune to meet her. Every year to mark her anniversary, the Chanteloube community gathers to offer tsok and commemorate her extraordinary life.
