Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche is the third son of the late Kangyur Rinpoche and one of the directors of Songtsen. He was recognized by Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche and H.H. the 16th Karmapa as the incarnation of Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö. Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche spent his childhood in Darjeeling. 

Later he passed much of his time with Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche in India, Nepal and Bhutan, receiving many precious teachings. 

In 1980, Rinpoche came to Europe with his mother and the rest of his family.

Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche teaches in both French and English—in France and various other countries. He also oversees Padmakara’s projects and supervises the translation of texts from Tibetan into Western languages.
