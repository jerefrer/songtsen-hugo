Songtsen was founded by Taklung Tsetrul Pema Wangyal Rinpoche, the eldest son of the late Kangyur Rinpoche. Pema Wangyal Rinpoche was born in Rong Drakmar, central Tibet. His family escaped from Tibet in 1958 and eventually settled in Darjeeling, India. After Kangyur Rinpoche passed away in 1975, Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and his family came to in Dordogne, France.

He also supervises the translation and preservation work of the Padmakara Translation Group in France.|

At the request of Dharma groups and institutions around the world, Rinpoche has been active as a teacher since 1975, giving public talks, leading seminars and providing individual guidance. Since 1980, Rinpoche has personally supervised the traditional three-year retreat of intensive study and practice in Dordogne, France. In 1999, he inaugurated a series of retreats in parallel with the three-year retreat, thus enabling Buddhist practitioners with family responsibilities to engage in serious and sustained practice.
