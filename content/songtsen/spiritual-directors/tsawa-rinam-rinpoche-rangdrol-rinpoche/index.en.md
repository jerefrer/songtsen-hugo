Tsawa Rinam Rinpoche, more commonly known as Rangdrol Rinpoche, is the second son of Kangyur Rinpoche. He was recognised by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche as the incarnation of Tsawa Rinam Namgyal, one of the principal disciples of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Jamgön Kongtrul, and also as an emanation of Namkha’i Nyingpo, one of the closest disciples of Guru Rinpoche, who went to Tibet in the eighth century and was himself an emanation of the great master Hungkara, one of the eight great Vidyādharas of India. 

Rinpoche studied first with Kangyur Rinpoche and later spent many years studying and receiving rare oral transmissions and empowerments from Dudjom Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, H. H. the Dalai Lama, and Trulshik Rinpoche. 

Rinpoche teaches regularly in the traditional three-year retreats and from time to time leads group retreats. In addition to teaching, he spends a large portion of his time in meditative retreat, thus continuing the activity of his father Kangyur Rinpoche. His teaching activities take him to various countries in Europe: France, Portugal, Finland, Holland and elsewhere. Rinpoche is thus gives much support to the work of Songtsen. He is also one of the main teachers and directos of the monastery of Orgyen Kunzang Chökhor Ling at Darjeeling in India.
