  ##  Sitapaila : The construction of a Tibetan monastic institute near Kathmandu, Nepal

  This new monastery, located in the hills overlooking the villages of Sitapaila and Swayambhu, in the Kathmandu valley, will be a place where the Buddhist monastic tradition will be upheld and where Tibetan and Western monks will be able to study and practice according to the tradition of Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche

  ##  Do-ngak Choling : The construction of a Tibetan monastery at Lumbini, south Nepal

  This was the birthplace of the Buddha and is one of the eight most sacred pilgrimage sites in the Buddhist world. At the moment, there is no adequate accommodation for monastics in Lumbini. The new monastery will be associated with the tradition of Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche and will provide, among other things, shelter for Tibetan refugees who make the arduous and dangerous journey on pilgrimage from Tibet to Nepal and India.

  ##  Library project for the preservation, research and translation of Tibetan text, Dordogne, France

  Pema Wangyal Rinpoche and his family preserve one of the most extensive collections of Tibetan texts in the world – many of which are now the last remaining copies. It contains many unique books, some of which are more than ten centuries old. It has become an urgent priority to create a facility to properly store these texts, where they can be of service to scholars, translators and to the interested public. Providing access to texts that are now virtually unavailable, the facility will undoubtedly function as one of the most important Tibetan Buddhist research centres in the world. The library will also house ancient and original texts in a climate-controlled environment where texts will not be damaged by dust, dampness, or other deteriorating factors.

  ##  The Maratika school project : This involves the construction and maintenance of school buildings in a poor village in the east of Nepal

  The Maratika project aims to provide children with primary and secondary education. Since 1990, KRF has financed the repair of the old primary school and the construction, and then enlargement, of a secondary school. It also pays the teachers’ salaries, thus providing the children with a level of education that will allow them to find adequate work or to have access to institutes of higher learning.

  ##  Support for Tibetan refugees : This has meant the provision of resources for economic development

  Every year, KRF sponsors Tibetan refugees in India, Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhutan, in the field of economic and cultural development. There is a strong focus on the preservation of the Tibetan Buddhist cultural heritage. KRF supports Tibetan communities either through sustained assistance or by the subsidy of specific “one-off” projects

  ##  Student grants in India, Nepal, and Tibet

  KRF regular supplies funding for the education of children and young adults in the Himalayan region. It is the aim of KRF to provide access to education and training to as many people as possible, regardless of ethnic background and religious allegiance, thus helping them to independence and self-sufficiency. In particular, KRF aims to help educate young Tibetans with a view to the preservation of their endangered culture.

  ##  Animal rescue

  The rescue of animals destined for slaughter is a regular activity of Pema Wangyal Rinpoche, his family, and a group of friends and supporters. This involves either the buying of animals and insects held in captivity and releasing them in their natural environment, or the finding of good homes for neglected and abandoned domestic animals. This is an active expression of non-violence and expresses a fundamental principle of the Buddhist teachings.

  ##  Construction of Stupas an expression of aspirations for peace in the world

  As an expression of its aspirations for peace in the world, Songtsen occasionally constructs stupas. These extraordinary monuments are a remarkable feature of sacred Buddhist architecture. They are symbols of the enlightened nature of the mind and are believed radiate blessing and wholesome energy in the human and natural environments in which they are placed.
