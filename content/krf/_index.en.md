Kangyur Rinpoche 

The KRF development projects are part of a humanitarian initiative that began over forty years ago, inspired and guided by Kangyur Rinpoche (1187-1975). These projects are supervised by the Kangyur Rinpoche Foundation and various other organizations. One of our main activities has been to provide resources and support infrastructures adapted to the economic and cultural development of Tibetan refugee communities in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, and—since the 1980s—inside Tibet itself. 

“Tibet, with its unique cultural heritage, permeated as it is with Buddhist spirituality, is today confronted by the very real threat of extinction. Intentially or otherwise, a kind of cultural genocide is taking place. And time is running out…”   
  
~ His Holiness the 14th Dalaï Lama

His Holiness the Dalaï-Lama escaping from Tibet 

The communist Cultural Revolution and the years of repression that followed have caused irreparable damage to the extraordinary cultural heritage of Tibet. And yet all is not lost. With immense courage, the Tibetan people continues to resist oppression and its younger generation is struggling to maintain its cultural identity. For the community of Tibetans in exile, the start of the new millenium has been a turning point. Of the 111 000 Tibetans who sought refuge in India in the late 1950s and early 1960s, were some of the last authentic representatives of a thousand-year wisdom tradition that is without a parallel in the modern world. Very few of these elder teachers remain, and it is vital to provide them with the means to pass on their extraordinary heritage to the younger generation of Tibetas, and to the rest of the world.With extraordinary foresight, many Tibetan Buddhist masters were able to escape annihilation at the hands of the Chinese communists. They made their way to India, bringing with them precious texts, sacred paintings, treasured images and ceremonial instruments. But in order to save the traditions of Tibet, it is not sufficient simply to conserve cultural artifacts and to display them in museums. The greatest emphasis must be placed on effective transmission and training in the skills proper to Tibet’s cultural and artistic traditions, and on an understanding of its rich and complex symbolism.

Even more important is the preservation of the extraordinary wisdom tradition that these great teachers brought with them into exile. This spiritual patrimony can only be passed on to students who are willing to devote their lives to its study and practice. And in any society, the conditions for genuine transmission are difficult to assemble. 

Many young refugees born outside Tibet have an earnest desire to embrace and maintain their tradition but they are hampered by the need to find a livelihood and to become integrated into modern society. They need education to a standard suited to the economic demands of their host countries. They also need opportunites for training in their own traditions if they so wish. The continuity of Tibetan culture depends entirely on the ability of the younger generation to study and assimilate their own cultural heritage. 

Whenever the risks are not too great, a few refugees are already returning to Tibet, taking with them not only their modern educations but also the traditional knowledge that years of oppression has all but eradicated in their homeland. Conversely, young people from inside Tibet who wish to pursue their Buddhist faith risk great danger by escaping to Nepal and India in search of teachers, spiritual communities, and, above all, the freedom to practice. Moreover, despite the dangers, several communities of practitioners led by courageous teachers, have grown up in Tibet itself, where they are contributing to the revival of Buddhism on their home territory. Whether they are still in Tibet or living in exile, the Tibetan people all cherish the same ideals. 

The rapid spread of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, called forth by keen interest of certain Westerners in the Buddhist path, has greatly contributed to the growth of interest in the plight of the Tibetans and the need to preserve their heritage. Since many in the West are open to the kind of values promoted in Tibetan Buddhism, the next step is to do what we can to preserve and protect this ancient tradition of spiritual training in an authentic a state as it is possible to maintain.

Strongly focussed on the need to preserve the Buddhist culture of Tibet, KRF Development works to safeguard the identity of Himalayan communities by providing the kind of infrastructure necessary for the preservation and tranmission of their cultural patrimony. Its particular targets are groups who do not benefit from other international aid programmes.
