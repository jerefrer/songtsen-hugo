After a long and perilous journey into exile from Chinese-occupied Tibet, Kangyur Rinpoche established himself in India. After passing from one temporary lodging to another in and around Darjeeling, he was, by the late 1960s, cheerfully ensconced, along with his family and a very large collection of precious books, in a modest dwelling with a leaky corrugated iron roof.Somewhat reluctantly, he accepted the invitation of some of his Western disciples to move to Angus Lodge, a large old colonial villa on the outskirts of the town dating back to the time when Darjeeling was British hill-station.

Kangyur Rinpoche immediately installed his precious library in the spacious rooms and set his family to copying by hand the rarest and most endangered manuscripts. Rinpoche also welcomed would-be Western disciples. He took in orphaned children, handicapped people of all kinds, old and blind monks and nuns. He treated the sick (both human beings and animals), he fed the hungry and consoled grief-stricken in an unending stream of love and compassion. He used to classify the objects of his concern into four groups: children in need, the chronically sick, the aged, and those who wished to devote their lives to spiritual practice. Over the years, Angus Lodge was somehow transformed into a Tibetan-style monastery and changed its name to Orgyen Kunzang Chökhorling. It still functions today as a monastery, a reference library, an orphanage, a school, and a medical welfare centre. 

In 1970, the Kangyur Rinpoche Trust was founded to hold the property deeds for the monastery. Later, at Rinpoche’s behest, the funds donated by well-wishers were used to support schools, monasteries and other projects, in refugee settlements that had no other means of support, both in India and Nepal. 

Kangyur Rinpoche’s wonderful life came to an end in 1975. His eldest son, Pema Wangyal Rinpoche, together with Gerard Godet and Peter Benson, first created the Kangyur Rinpoche Foundation in 1980, in order to perpetuate Kangyur Rinpoche’s activities in India, Tibet and in the West. In 1982, the Foundation was established as a registered charity in the UK.

This first KRF team set to work supporting Tibetan exiled communities that had so far been overlooked by other international aid organizations. The main focus was on education, and on accommodation for students and old people with a view to promoting and encouraging self-sufficiency. In those early days, the funding was limited and very little had to go a long way. Largely, it was a question of day-to-day survival. 

The terrible plight of Tibet and therefore of the exiled community has lasted far longer than anyone had feared. The difficult task of survival has therefore grown into the need to begin a new life in a foreign land and to establish more long-term projects. KRF has therefore come to promote the creation of lasting infrastructures for the preservation of Tibetan culture, for the conservation of a sacred literature and for the transmision of an endangered but still living spiritual trasition. 

Since its creation, KRF has been directed by Pema Wangyal Rinpoche. The number of trustees has grown from 5 to 12 (as of 2011), and at the moment includes a doctor, an engineer, a school director, several school teachers and other professionals. 

In the last few years, two sister organisations have been created in Portugal and the USA, and both are recognised as non-profit organisations run by local administrators.

KRF Development projects are managed by a group of Tibetan and Western volunteers who have a thorough knowledge of the real conditions of Tibetans in exile and Himalayan communities in difficulty. We have well defined objectives that correspond to the genuine requirements of the people concerned and that are sufficiently flexible to adapt to the needs of economic survival as well as the overall imperative to preserve cultural and traditional identity. KRF Development projects emphasize collaboration with local administrators who are respected and trusted by their communities.
