#  Objectives 

For the KRF, the preservation of the cultural and spiritual traditions of Tibet involves both a practical assistance focused on the survival and development of the Tibetan people—whether in Tibet or in exile—followed by specific support for the preservation and practice of its spiritual traditions. Our activities have developed along three main lines. 

####  To provide Himalayan communities with access to education and economic autonomy by the following means : 

  * The construction of schools, universities, and monastic institutes, together with accommodation and facilities for students. 
  * To bring education to impoverished children and young people by means of sponsorships and grants. 
  * To promote arts and crafts as a means to preserve traditional culture. 
  * To develop training schemes various skills and modern technologies in such fields as building, wood-carving, painting and sculpture, as well as computer, language, and translation skills.

For Tibetan culture to survive, whether inside or outside Tibet, the first priority is to provide material support for Tibetans who are often living in conditions of great poverty. However free they may be to practice their religion, the fact is that the majority of Tibetan refugees are struggling simply to survive on the material level.

Moreover, uprooted from their tradition, many young Tibetans try to adapt to the values of the modern world and naturally fall under influence of western culture. So for instance they might turn to modern medicine and neglect the practice of the Tibetan medical tradition. Confronted by the difficulties of living as refugees in a foreign country, young people are also very vulnerable to the misuse of drugs and alcohol. From the beginning, the Foundation has consistently supported Tibetan families in need and in the education of children and young people in the Himalayan region. 

####  The Foundation is committed to helping Tibetan communities preserve their own identity and safeguard their cultural heritage. Its efforts are focused on : 

  * The recovery and preservation of Tibetan texts through restoration, calligraphic transcription and the digital input and archiving of texts. 
  * The restauration and construction of traditional Buddhist monuments and works of art. 
  * The establishment of library facilities for the preservation and consultation of Tibetan texts.

Once the physical and economic survival of the Tibetan community is ensured, it is necessary to work for the survival and transmission of its cultural tradition. This goes far beyond the preservation of folk art and traditional crafts. The Tibetan wisdom tradition, deeply rooted in the Buddhist teachings that have been preserved and developed in Tibet for over a thousand years, has an important role to play in the spiritual development of humanity itself. 

Over the last few decades, KRF has gained considerable experience and has provided substantial assistance in the contruction and support of a number of monasteries and institutes of higher learning. This has meant not only the provision of living quarters for a large number of Tibetans, but also practical help in the preservation and perpetuation of Tibet’s spiritual patrimony. The construction of a Tibetan monastery, for example, is a perfect opportunity for painters, sculptors, and craftsment, to pursue their centuries-old traditions and to pass them on to a younger generation. 

Large Tibetan monasteries traditionally include training colleges for the advanced study of Buddhist doctrine, and also retreat facilities for the prolonged and intensive practice of meditation. The monasteries are also the venue for ceremonies, religious festivals, and sacred dance, all of which lie at the heart of traditional Tibetan life. Finally, the monasteries are places of hospitality where visitors may meet spiritual masters and benefit from their teaching. 

####  Increasingly, the monasteries are a meeting place where Westerners may come for instruction in Buddhist teachings : 

  * where they may meet and study with Tibetan experts in the various branches of traditional learning : sacred architecture, medicine, astrology, painting, and so on. 
  * Supporting cultural events 
  * Building sacred Buddhist monuments in the West, such as stupas

In addition to helping Tibetans in Asia, it is important to make the profound teachings of the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition available to people all over the world.   
Here too, KRF’s role has been to provide the material infrastructure needed to edit and translate Buddhist texts, and to encourage the transmission, explanation, and study of Buddhist teachings as a way of life in the most authentic manner.

In the West, KRF therefore supports the work of organizations like Chanteloube and Padmakara, both of which frequently invite Tibetan lamas and specialists to give courses in various aspects of Buddhist learning: philosophy, medicine, astrology, painting, and so on—occasionally organizing cultural events assiciated with these topics 

KRF Development has also participated in the construction, in several countries, of Buddhist stupas: a visible and tangible form of the universal message of peace and happiness that is at the heart of the Buddhist teachings. 

The primary goal of the Foundation has always been to bring help and protection to those in need: children, the sick, the aged, impoverished communities and so forth—independently of their cultural and ethnic background and their religious allegiance. We “specialise” in helping Tibetan refugees, but our projects in Nepal and India are entirely open to local populations generally, notably in the “bamboo schools ” movement: the Pegasus Project for the schooling of street children in Baudha and Maratika where more than 700 of all ethnicities and cultures now have access to a high-quality education that is entirely free.
