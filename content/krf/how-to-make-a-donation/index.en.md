##  Helping KRF 

From its creation until now, the Kangyur Rinpoche Foundation and its sister organizations have been funded by a handful of dedicated donors. The time has now come to allow others to participate in this rewarding work. As KRF’s projects continue to expand, the need for sponsors and donations is ever more urgent. Any donation, however small or large, is of help and is greatly appreciated. 

Various foundations have been set up to collect and send funds to support KRF Development’s projects : 

  * Kangyur Rinpoche Foundation (UK, USA and Portugal) 
  * Fondation d’Entraide Bouddhique Internationale (Switzerland) 
  * Fondation Padmasambhava (France).
